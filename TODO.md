# TODO

## Core features/what I hope to finish

- [x] Project scaffold & configuration
- [ ] Google OAuth authentication module
- [ ] Gmail client with rate limiting
- [ ] LLM extraction service (Qwen 2.5 3B via Ollama)
- [ ] Google Sheets client with batching
- [ ] State persistence & resume functionality
- [ ] CLI entry point with `--since` flag

## very low chance of happening

- [ ] Duplicate detection (skip emails already in sheet)
- [ ] `--until` date filter for date range queries
- [ ] Dry-run preview mode
- [ ] Custom Gmail query filter via CLI
- [ ] Multiple LLM backend support (llama.cpp, transformers)
- [ ] Progress bar with estimated time remaining
- [ ] Email body parsing (beyond subject line)
- [ ] Configurable spreadsheet column mapping
- [ ] Unit tests with full coverage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
